<p>In general, when you sign up to a social media website’s terms, you are responsible<br>
     for any claims brought against them by third parties relating to your content -<br>
 for example where you upload content that infringes someone else’s copyright. <br>
  This is known as an indemnity.Some websites have particularly broad indemnity<br>
   provisions which mean that users are also liable for the legal costs of all claims<br>
   made against the website,even if it turns out there was no infringement of copyright.<br>
 
Social media websites do not generally accept liability for loss of data so it would <br>
be advisible to keep backups of any of your content offline.This is also relevant <br>
where you use one account across several platforms e.g. Google+ and Google Drive,<br>
 as you risk losing access to your work.</p>
